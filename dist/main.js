You\\'re my only hope.',\n  'You\\'re asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do.

I don\\'t believe we have been introduced. R2-D2? A pleasure to meet you. I am C-3PO, Human-Cyborg Relations.',\n  'Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be.

And I know I shouldn\\'t.',\n  'Feel, don\\'t think.',\n  'I\\'ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.',\n  'I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.',\n  'At the thought of not being with you, I can\\'t breathe.',\n  'Don\\'t try to frighten us with your sorcerous ways, Lord Vader.',\n  'It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force... but by our skills with a lightsaber.',\n  'Wipe them out. All of them.',\n  'Look, sir: Droids.',\n  'If you\\'re not with me, then you\\'re my enemy.',\n  'May the force be with you.',\n  'A Jedi Knight?

He is your master now.',\n  'The Chancellor\\'s right, Senator. We\\'ll be quite safe. He won several cups for airspeeder racing back on Naboo.',\n  'No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.',\n  'Anything is possible.',\n  'Your arrogance blinds you.',\n  'I\\'m haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar.',\n  'Only a sith deals in absolutes.',\n  'We live in a real world, Annie. Come back to it.',\n  'So, what do you think? You think a princess and a guy like me...',\n  'Don\\'t center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.',\n  'I\\'ll be careful.',\n  'Who\\'s the more foolish: the fool, or the fool who follows him?',\n  'General, prepare your men.',\n  'The strong survive, the weak die. That\\'s the way the galaxy works. The day we forgot that, we became everyone\\'s lackey.',\n  'We have powerful friends. You\\'re going to regret this.',\n  'I\\'ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I\\'ve never seen anything to make me believe there\\'s one all-powerful Force controlling everything.',\n  'Maybe you\\'d like it back in your cell, your highness.',\n  'I want them alive - no disintegrations!',\n  'A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.',\n  'I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.',\n  'We have a new enemy, the young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star.

Oh, my goodness, oh!',\n  'That\\'s no moon, it\\'s a space station.',\n  'The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth... Vader.',\n  'You slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler. You\\'ve got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.',\n  'Soon, I will have a new apprentice. One far younger, and more powerful.',\n  'You\\'re all clear, kid! Now let\\'s blow this thing and go home!',\n  'He\\'s the brains, sweetheart!',\n  'You will find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.',\n  'I\\'m a person, and my name is Anakin!',\n  'This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!
